### **Complex Document Analysis with Azure OpenAI**

#### **Details**

**What’s This Session About?**
Manufacturing teams rely on detailed, often lengthy documents—SOPs, maintenance manuals, QA protocols—that are hard to search and digest under time pressure.

**How Do We Fix This?**

- ✔️ Setting up Azure AI Search to power real-time document Q&A interfaces

#### **Session Takeaways:**
- ✔️ Architecture patterns for multi-agent document intelligence systems
- ✔️ Live demo: Extracting structured BoM data from engineering diagrams
- ✔️ Tips for automating document classification, tagging, and compliance checks
- ✔️ Sample implementations and real-world use cases from the shop floor
